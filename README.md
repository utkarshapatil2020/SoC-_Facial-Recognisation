# SoC_Facial-Recognitition

# Check Point 1 (11th April 2021)

## Task 1 
Pandas exercise : We learnt how to import pandas and numpy.Used some library functions in order to extract information from the dataset.

## Task 2 
Matplotlib exercises: In this task we plotted different histograms, various plots. Also we learnt about statistical different datasets.


# CheckPoint 2 (10th June 2021)

Open CV : Jupyter-based Age and Gender detection model using pre-trained deep learning models
          We learnt many libraries from the OpenCV. We make a code using OpenCV for finding the gender and age of a person.
       

# CheckPoint 3( 18th July 2021)

Final submission.
We learnt TensorFlow lite and their examples. In this task using different libraries we make a code through which we can recognize the faces from photos and videos.
